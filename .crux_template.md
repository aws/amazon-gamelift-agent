## Notes
Enter notes about your change here.

## Formatting
Code/comments from this package will be published on a public github page for all customers to see.
Spend some extra time reviewing to make sure everything is clear and professional sounding.
* Copyright: Every file must have a copyright comment at the top.
* Ownership: Avoid words like we, they, you, customer.  Use Amazon GameLift, thread, client, etc.
* Comment formatting: Use complete sentences and styling since our comments are essentially public documentation.
* Terminology:
  * Use processUUID, not processID.
  * Use computeName, not computeId, hostId, instanceId, etc.
  * Use location over remoteLocation.
  * Use complete terms like certificatePath over certPath.  This helps with translation to other languages.
  * Use publicly defined exception types, not BadRequestException, etc.
  * Use descriptive wording to explain impact, avoid badVariable, goodVariable, etc.
